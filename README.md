# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Tayebwa Crispus


## Dataset

- The Prosper loan dataset comprises of 113937 loan entries with 81 attributes on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others, during the year 2009-2014. There are two primary categories:

Borrower information: Basic qualities of the borrowers such as annual income, condition of employment, interest rate, loan status, etc. Loan performance information: Metrics analyzing the risk connected with the loans such as Prosper score and bank card utilization, etc.


## Summary of Findings
- Our findings regarding borrower motivations were unexpected. The majority of persons appeared to have used loans to finance existing debt rather than taking out loans to launch enterprises or buy assets. The largest average loan amounts obtained through the platform are for debt consolidation. Aside from using large loans for business objectives, borrowers appear to rely on them to pay for engagement rings, marriages, and adoptions of children and boats.

- Most of the loans in the data set are current loans. Past due loans are split in several groups based on the length of payment delay. Other big part is completed loans, defaulted loans compromise a minority, however chargedoff loans also compromise a substanial amount.


## Key Insights for Presentation

- Some of the objectives for this investigation are:

To establish whether borrowers are taking on more debt than their income can support.
To establish which State has the most listings that borrowers have created.
